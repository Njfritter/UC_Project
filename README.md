# UC-Tuition-Costs
### Abstract: 
UC Project: An Investigation into the UC system’s enrollment, tuition and spending trends over the past 10 years

### Analyzing: 
*	Student Enrollment 
* Faculty-Student Ratio 
* Tuition Costs 
* Average Income of Americans by Education Level 


**Hypothesis:**
UC tuition costs have more quadrupled in the past 10 years, vastly exceeding inflation rates and, in some cases, surmounting the ROI completely, leading one to question whether a college degree is still worth it's price tag. This project is intended to investigate increases in attendance costs parallel to shifts in household income (and related economic indices) over the past 10 years.



**Side Note:**
*UC in-state tuition in 2006: $2,541 (which would be $3117.27 in today’s dollars, accounting for an averaged 1.88% inflation rate over the 10 year span) 

*UC in-state tuition in 2017: $13,500
